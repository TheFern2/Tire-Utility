# Tire-Utility
A simple utility that pulls part numbers quickly.

I created a simple console application to quickly show
part numbers for all of our forklift models without having
to pull each manual and look up the old fashion way.

Keep in mind our forklift operators went thru tires like 
there was no tomorrow. So this helped tremendously.
Also I was a beginner programmer when I did this utility.
I couldn't find the source code so I uploaded the zip file.

The utility is a simple menu, that shows all forklift models.
On the next menu you can see all tires available for that specific
model.

Enjoy!
